                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <h4>Definition of Stewardship: "All things on earth belong to the Lord; we are His stewards” (Doctrine & Covenants 104:12; see also Matthew 25:14–23).</h4>
                    <h4>Purpose: Prosperity is not ownership, but accountability. We prosper when we manage God’s gifts faithfully.</h4>

                <article class="gratitude card">
                    <h3>Gratitude</h3>
                    <h4>Doctrinal foundation: “Whoso is found a faithful steward shall enter into the joy of his Lord” (D&C 51:19).</h4>
                    <h4>Teaching: Elder Quentin L. Cook emphasized that stewardship is a sacred trust, not self‑gratification: <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2009/10/stewardship-a-sacred-trust?lang=eng">Stewardship—a Sacred Trust</a></h4>
                    <h5>Accountability to God<br>
                    Many in the world reject responsibility, but disciples of Christ recognize that we are accountable to God for our choices.<br>
                    This accountability is described as “obedience to the unenforceable”—doing right because we love God, not because we are compelled.<br>
                    Stewardship of Self and Family<br>
                    We are stewards over our bodies, minds, families, and talents.<br>
                    Parents must prioritize spiritual nourishment alongside physical needs.<br>
                    At judgment, two key questions will concern our relationship with our spouse and our children.<br>
                    Stewardship for the Poor and Needy<br>
                    Caring for those in need is a divine commandment, with strong warnings against neglect.<br>
                    Practices like fasting and fast offerings exemplify Christlike service.<br>
                    Stories of faithful members (like an elderly widow serving despite limited means) highlight the spirit of sacrifice.<br>
                    Moral Stewardship<br>
                    Elder Cook uses the metaphor of a polluted spring to emphasize the importance of protecting virtue and chastity.<br>
                    Repentance through Christ’s Atonement restores purity, just as the spring was cleansed.<br>
                    Christlike Service<br>
                    The Church responds quietly and quickly to global needs because of members’ generosity.<br>
                    Service is modeled after Jesus Christ, who taught and exemplified love and sacrifice.</h5>
                    <h4>Application:<br>
                    Keep a gratitude journal (write 3 blessings daily).<br>
                    Express thanks in prayer for temporal and spiritual gifts.</h4>

                    <h3>Tithing</h3>
                    <h4>Biblical foundation: “Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse… and prove me now herewith” (Malachi 3:10).</h4>
                    <h4>Teaching: Tithing is a divine law of faith and stewardship: <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2023/10/22andersen?lang=eng">Tithing: Opening the Windows of Heaven</a></h4>
                    <h5>Faith and Trust in God<br>
                    Tithing is not just about money—it is a matter of faith.<br>
                    Paying tithing shows our willingness to put the Lord first, above personal interests.<br>
                    Promises of Protection and Blessing<br>
                    Elder Andersen shares the story of a Venezuelan family whose bakery was spared during riots, which they attributed to their faithfulness in paying tithing.<br>
                    The Lord promises both spiritual and temporal blessings, including protection from evil.<br>
                    Sacred Stewardship of Church Funds<br>
                    Tithes belong to the Lord, not to Church leaders.<br>
                    Leaders are accountable to God for their use, funding temples, missionary work, education, and humanitarian aid.<br>
                    Global Impact of Tithing<br>
                    Over a billion dollars in aid blessed those in need last year.<br>
                    Tithing supports 71,000 missionaries, 177 operating temples (with many more planned), and education for 145,000 students.<br>
                    Blessings Beyond Wealth<br>
                    Elder Andersen recalls Elder Henry B. Eyring’s counsel that paying tithing diminishes the desire for material possessions.<br>
                    Testimonies from faithful Saints show that tithing brings peace, sufficiency, and spiritual abundance.<br>
                    Eternal Perspective<br>
                    Even at life’s end, faithful Saints prioritize tithing as a way to be “right before the Lord.”<br>
                    Tithing prepares us for eternal prosperity and participation in God’s work.</h5>
                    <h4>Application:<br>
                    Make tithing the first line in your budget.<br>
                    Consider additional offerings (fast offerings, humanitarian aid).</h4>
                    <h4>Reflection prompt: How does giving back to God shape my financial priorities?</h4>

                    <h3>Eternal Perspective</h3>
                    <h4>Doctrinal foundation: “Unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required” (Luke 12:48).</h4>
                    <h4>Teaching: Elder Dale G. Renlund taught that life continues after death, and our choices have eternal consequences: <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2014/03/maintaining-an-eternal-perspective?lang=eng">Maintaining an Eternal Perspective</a></h4>
                    <h5>Story of Mr. Brown<br>
                    A man near death received a heart transplant and miraculously recovered.<br>
                    Days later, he complained about cold oatmeal—forgetting the miracle he had just experienced.<br>
                    Lesson: We often lose sight of the bigger picture when focused only on immediate discomforts.<br>
                    Trials and Prosperity Both Test Perspective<br>
                    Hardship can cause despair, but prosperity can lead to forgetting God.<br>
                    Prophets like Moses, Mormon, and Brigham Young warned against losing gratitude and humility when blessed.<br>
                    Tangible Reminders of God’s Goodness<br>
                    Ancient Israel used physical symbols (frontlets, stones of remembrance, Ebenezer) to remember God’s miracles.<br>
                    These reminders helped them maintain perspective and gratitude.<br>
                    Modern Ebenezer: The Sacrament<br>
                    For Latter-day Saints, the bread and water of the sacrament serve as tangible reminders of Christ’s atoning sacrifice.<br>
                    Weekly renewal of covenants helps us keep an eternal perspective.<br>
                    Role of the Holy Ghost<br>
                    President Henry B. Eyring taught that the Holy Ghost brings God’s blessings and messages to our remembrance.<br>
                    The Spirit helps us see God’s hand in our lives and stay focused on eternal truths.</h5>
                    <h4>Application:<br>
                    Align spending with eternal values (family, service, education).<br>
                    Ask: Does this purchase bless my family or community?</h4>

                    <h3>Budget Wisely</h3>
                    <h4>“A budget is telling your money where to go instead of wondering where it went.” – John C. Maxwell</h4>
                    <h4>Teaching: Create an accurate spending plan that tracks income and expenses, plugs wasteful leaks, and intentionally aligns money choices with personal goals and values.

                    <h5>Spending Plan = Budget<br>
                    Page 12: A budget is framed as a spending plan—a tool to take control of your financial future and align money with your goals.<br>
                    Four Steps to Create a Spending Plan - Pages 12 - 14<br>
                    Identify your income – Use pay stubs, savings, and investment statements to calculate accurate monthly income.<br>
                    List your expenses – Track both fixed (rent, insurance) and variable (food, entertainment) costs.<br>
                    Compare income and expenses – See if you have a surplus or deficit.<br>
                    Set priorities and make changes – Cut back on leaks, increase income, or rebalance spending.<br>
                    Accuracy Matters<br>
                    Page 12: Don’t forget irregular bills (like car insurance every six months). Break them down into monthly amounts so your plan reflects reality.<br>
                    Mindful Spending<br>
                    Page 11: The guide encourages asking intentional questions before purchases: Why am I buying this? Is there a cheaper alternative? Does this align with my goals?<br>
                    Waste Awareness<br>
                    Pages 11 - 12: The average family wastes about 30% of income through unexamined spending habits. A budget helps reclaim that “lost” money—like giving yourself a 30% raise.<br>

                    <h3>Eliminate Debt</h3>
                    <h4>“Debt is like any other trap, easy enough to get into, but hard enough to get out.” – Henry Wheeler Shaw</h4>
                    <h4>Teaching: Eliminating debt is a step‑by‑step process of creating a repayment plan, cutting expenses, increasing income, and prioritizing high‑interest balances while avoiding new debt. Page 15 of: <a href="https://www.nefe.org/initiatives/Your-Spending-Your-Savings-Your-Future.pdf">Your Spending Your Savings Your Future</a></h4>
                    <h5>
                        Act quickly: Don’t wait to act, because debts compound over time. (p. 22)<br>
                        Create a debt recovery plan: Use a worksheet to organize debts by interest rate and prioritize repayment. (pp. 22–24)<br>
                        Snowball method: When one debt is paid off, continue making the same payment amount toward the next debt. (p. 22)<br>
                        Cut expenses: Identify areas to reduce spending and free up money for debt repayment. (p. 22)<br>
                        Sell unused items: Generate extra cash by selling rarely used possessions. (p. 22)<br>
                        Increase income: Consider overtime, a second job, or freelance work to accelerate repayment. (p. 22)<br>
                        Consolidate loans: Shift higher-interest debts into a single lower-rate loan. (p. 22)<br>
                        Limit credit card use: Keep only one or two major cards and stop adding new debt. (p. 22–23)<br>
                        Seek help if needed: Contact creditors directly, work with nonprofit credit counseling agencies, and avoid “credit repair” scams. (pp. 23–24)<br>
                        Bankruptcy as last resort: Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 are explained, but both have long-term consequences. (p. 25)

                    <h5>
                        New Agreements with Money (p. 6): The article encourages commitments like:<br>
                        “I will use my money so my family and I can live in decent housing in a safe neighborhood.”<br>
                        “I will use my money to promote the physical health and emotional well-being of my family and myself.”<br>
                        “I will use my money to help further the educational and personal growth of my family and myself.”<br>
                        “I will use my money to provide for a secure future.” These agreements frame wealth as a tool to bless family life, not just accumulate possessions.<br>
                        Grow Your Savings (p. 26):<br>
                        Saving is described as an act of faith in your future. Even small amounts, when compounded, grow into meaningful wealth that can support family goals.<br>
                        Set Financial Goals (p. 35): Families are encouraged to define goals—like education, housing, or retirement—and align saving habits to achieve them.<br>
                        Save for Emergencies (p. 40): Establishing an emergency fund is highlighted as a way to protect loved ones from unexpected hardships.<br>
                        Tax-Advantaged Accounts (pp. 41–44): Retirement and education accounts are presented as tools to build wealth that directly blesses family members in the long term.<br>
                        Insurance and Safeguards (p. 49):<br>
                        Using insurance to protect yourself, your assets, and your loved ones ensures that wealth serves as a shield for family stability.<br>
                        Financial Fraud Awareness (p. 46):<br>
                        Protecting savings from fraud is part of safeguarding family blessings.

                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <h4>Why Habits Matter</h4>
                    <h4>Daily disciplines and mindset shifts that align your life with purpose, based on James Clear's book: Atomic Habits</h4>
                    <h4>
                        Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.<br>
                        Prosperity isn’t just financial — it’s holistic: faith, family, health, and legacy.<br>
                        Frame habits as small, consistent actions that build a purposeful life.

                    <h5>
                        Core Idea: Every action is a vote for the type of person you want to become.<br>
                        Prosperity Connection: Prosperity flows from identity — “I am a wise steward,” “I am a giver,” “I am disciplined.”<br>
                        Reflection Prompt: What identity do I want my habits to reinforce?<br>
                        Action Step: Write one “I am” statement that connects prosperity to your values.

                    <h5>
                        Core Idea: Habits start with cues.<br>
                        Prosperity Connection: Place visible reminders where they matter — budget tracker on the fridge, gratitude journal on your nightstand.<br>
                        Reflection Prompt: What visual cue could remind me to act in alignment with my purpose?<br>
                        Action Step: Create one physical or digital cue for a prosperity habit.

                        Prosperity Connection: Saving becomes joyful when tied to family goals; prayer feels uplifting with music.<br>

                        Prosperity Connection: Automate savings, prep meals, set reminders. Prosperity thrives on systems, not willpower.<br>
                        Reflection Prompt: What friction is keeping me from living with purpose?<br>
