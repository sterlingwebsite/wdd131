                        <h3>Budget Wisely</h3>
                        <p>“A budget is telling your money where to go instead of wondering where it went.” – John C. Maxwell</p>
                        <h4>Teaching</h4>
                        <p>Create an accurate spending plan that tracks income and expenses, plugs wasteful leaks, and intentionally aligns money choices with personal goals and values. Page 11 of:</p>

                            <h5>Spending Plan = Budget</h5>
                            <p>Page 12: A budget is framed as a spending plan—a tool to take control of your financial future and align money with your goals.</p>
                            <h5>Four Steps to Create a Spending Plan - Pages 12 - 14</h5>
                            <p>Identify your income – Use pay stubs, savings, and investment statements to calculate accurate monthly income.</p>
                            <p>List your expenses – Track both fixed (rent, insurance) and variable (food, entertainment) costs.</p>
                            <p>Compare income and expenses – See if you have a surplus or deficit.</p>
                            <p>Set priorities and make changes – Cut back on leaks, increase income, or rebalance spending.</p>
                            <h5>Accuracy Matters</h5>
                            <p>Page 12: Don’t forget irregular bills (like car insurance every six months). Break them down into monthly amounts so your plan reflects reality.</p>
                            <h5>Mindful Spending</h5>
                            <p>Page 11: The guide encourages asking intentional questions before purchases: Why am I buying this? Is there a cheaper alternative? Does this align with my goals?</p>
                            <h5>Waste Awareness</h5>
                            <p>Pages 11 - 12: The average family wastes about 30% of income through unexamined spending habits. A budget helps reclaim that “lost” money—like giving yourself a 30% raise.</p>
                            <h5>Tools & Resources - Pages 11 - 12</h5>
                            <p>Worksheets for mindful spending and debt recovery</p>
                            <p>Online tools like the Budget Wizard at Smart About Money (referenced in the text)</p>

                        <h4>Application</h4>
                        <p>Build your spending plan</p>

                        <p>Practice Mindful Spending</p>
                        <p>Reclaim the lost 30%</p>
                        <p>Use tools and resources</p>
                        <h4>Reflection prompt</h4>
                        <p>Think about your last three purchases. For each one, ask yourself: Did this expense align with my goals and values, or was it more of a leak in my spending plan? If it was a leak, how could I redirect that money toward something purposeful next time?</p>

                        <h3>Eliminate Debt</h3>
                        <p>“Debt is like any other trap, easy enough to get into, but hard enough to get out.” – Henry Wheeler Shaw</p>
                        <h4>Teaching</h4>

                            <h5>Seek help if needed</h5>
                                <p>Contact creditors directly, work with nonprofit credit counseling agencies, and avoid “credit repair” scams. (pp. 23–24)</p>
                            <h5>Bankruptcy as last resort</h5>
                                <p>Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 are explained, but both have long-term consequences. (p. 25)</p>

                        <h4>Reflection prompt</h4>
                        <p>Think about your current relationship with debt. How does the idea that debt is a trap—easy to enter but hard to escape—resonate with your own experiences? As you consider strategies like cutting expenses, increasing income, or using the snowball method, which step feels most realistic for you to begin with today, and why? What obstacles might you face, and how could you prepare to overcome them?</p>

                        <h3>Build Wealth to Bless Your Family</h3>
                        <p>"The greatest legacy we can leave our children is happy memories and financial freedom." — Andy Hill</p>
                        <h4>Teaching</h4>
                        <p>Money is a means to secure housing, health, education, and a future for your family. Wealth is a tool to bless, protect, and empower those you love.</p>

                            <h5>New Agreements with Money (p. 6)</h5>
                            <h5 class="second-heading">The article encourages commitments like:</h5>

                            <p>“I will use my money to provide for a secure future.” These agreements frame wealth as a tool to bless family life, not just accumulate possessions.</p>
                            <h5>Grow Your Savings (p. 26)</h5>
                            <p>Saving is described as an act of faith in your future. Even small amounts, when compounded, grow into meaningful wealth that can support family goals.</p>

                            <h5>Save for Emergencies (p. 40)</h5>
                            <p>Establishing an emergency fund is highlighted as a way to protect loved ones from unexpected hardships.</p>

                            <p>Retirement and education accounts are presented as tools to build wealth that directly blesses family members in the long term.</p>
                            <h5>Insurance and Safeguards (p. 49)</h5>
                            <p>Using insurance to protect yourself, your assets, and your loved ones ensures that wealth serves as a shield for family stability.</p>
                            <h5>Financial Fraud Awareness (p. 46)</h5>
                            <p>Protecting savings from fraud is part of safeguarding family blessings.</p>

                        <p>In what ways am I currently using money as a tool to bless, protect, and empower my family?
