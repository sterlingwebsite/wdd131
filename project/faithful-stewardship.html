                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <h4>Definition of Stewardship</h4>
                        <p>"All things on earth belong to the Lord; we are His stewards” (Doctrine & Covenants 104:12; see also Matthew 25:14–23).</p>
                        <h4>Purpose</h4>
                        <p>Prosperity is not ownership, but accountability. We prosper when we manage God’s gifts faithfully.</p>

                        <h3>Gratitude</h3>
                        <h4>Doctrinal foundation</h4>
                        <p>“Whoso is found a faithful steward shall enter into the joy of his Lord” (D&C 51:19).</p>
                        <h4>Teaching</h4>
                        <p>Elder Quentin L. Cook emphasized that stewardship is a sacred trust, not self‑gratification:</p>
                        <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2009/10/stewardship-a-sacred-trust?lang=eng">Stewardship—a Sacred Trust</a>
                        <div class="collapsible">
                            <h5>Accountability to God</h5>
                            <p>Many in the world reject responsibility, but disciples of Christ recognize that we are accountable to God for our choices.</p>
                            <p>This accountability is described as “obedience to the unenforceable”—doing right because we love God, not because we are compelled.</p>
                            <h5>Stewardship of Self and Family</h5>
                            <p>We are stewards over our bodies, minds, families, and talents.</p>
                            <p>Parents must prioritize spiritual nourishment alongside physical needs.</p>
                            <p>At judgment, two key questions will concern our relationship with our spouse and our children.</p>
                            <h5>Stewardship for the Poor and Needy</h5>
                            <p>Caring for those in need is a divine commandment, with strong warnings against neglect.</p>
                            <p>Practices like fasting and fast offerings exemplify Christlike service.</p>
                            <p>Stories of faithful members (like an elderly widow serving despite limited means) highlight the spirit of sacrifice.</p>
                            <h5>Moral Stewardship</h5>
                            <p>Elder Cook uses the metaphor of a polluted spring to emphasize the importance of protecting virtue and chastity.</p>
                            <p>Repentance through Christ’s Atonement restores purity, just as the spring was cleansed.</p>
                            <h5>Christlike Service</h5>
                            <p>The Church responds quietly and quickly to global needs because of members’ generosity.</p>
                            <p>Service is modeled after Jesus Christ, who taught and exemplified love and sacrifice.</p>

                        <h4>Application</h4>
                        <p>Keep a gratitude journal (write 3 blessings daily).</p>
                        <p>Express thanks in prayer for temporal and spiritual gifts.</p>
                        <h4>Reflection prompt</h4>
                        <p>How does gratitude change the way I view prosperity?</p>

                        <h3>Tithing</h3>
                        <h4>Biblical foundation</h4>
                        <p>“Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse… and prove me now herewith” (Malachi 3:10).</p>
                        <h4>Teaching</h4>
                        <p>Tithing is a divine law of faith and stewardship:</p>
                        <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2023/10/22andersen?lang=eng">Tithing: Opening the<br>Windows of Heaven</a>
                        <div class="collapsible">
                            <h5>Faith and Trust in God</h5>
                            <p>Tithing is not just about money—it is a matter of faith.</p>
                            <p>Paying tithing shows our willingness to put the Lord first, above personal interests.</p>
                            <h5>Promises of Protection and Blessing</h5>
                            <p>Elder Andersen shares the story of a Venezuelan family whose bakery was spared during riots, which they attributed to their faithfulness in paying tithing.</p>
                            <p>The Lord promises both spiritual and temporal blessings, including protection from evil.</p>
                            <h5>Sacred Stewardship of Church Funds</h5>
                            <p>Tithes belong to the Lord, not to Church leaders.</p>
                            <p>Leaders are accountable to God for their use, funding temples, missionary work, education, and humanitarian aid.</p>
                            <h5>Global Impact of Tithing</h5>
                            <p>Over a billion dollars in aid blessed those in need last year.</p>
                            <p>Tithing supports 71,000 missionaries, 177 operating temples (with many more planned), and education for 145,000 students.</p>
                            <h5>Blessings Beyond Wealth</h5>
                            <p>Elder Andersen recalls Elder Henry B. Eyring’s counsel that paying tithing diminishes the desire for material possessions.</p>
                            <p>Testimonies from faithful Saints show that tithing brings peace, sufficiency, and spiritual abundance.</p>
                            <h5>Eternal Perspective</h5>
                            <p>Even at life’s end, faithful Saints prioritize tithing as a way to be “right before the Lord.”</p>
                            <p>Tithing prepares us for eternal prosperity and participation in God’s work.</p>
                        </div>
                        <h4>Application</h4>
                        <p>Make tithing the first line in your budget.</p>
                        <p>Consider additional offerings (fast offerings, humanitarian aid).</p>
                        <h4>Reflection prompt</h4>
                        <p>How does giving back to God shape my financial priorities?</p>

                        <h3>Eternal Perspective</h3>
                        <h4>Doctrinal foundation</h4>
                        <p>“Unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required” (Luke 12:48).</p>
                        <h4>Teaching</h4>
                        <p>Elder Dale G. Renlund taught that life continues after death, and our choices have eternal consequences:</p>
                        <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2014/03/maintaining-an-eternal-perspective?lang=eng">Maintaining an Eternal Perspective</a>
                        <div class="collapsible">
                            <h5>Story of Mr. Brown</h5>
                            <p>A man near death received a heart transplant and miraculously recovered.</p>
                            <p>Days later, he complained about cold oatmeal—forgetting the miracle he had just experienced.</p>
                            <p>Lesson: We often lose sight of the bigger picture when focused only on immediate discomforts.</p>
                            <h5>Trials and Prosperity Both Test Perspective</h5>
                            <p>Hardship can cause despair, but prosperity can lead to forgetting God.</p>
                            <p>Prophets like Moses, Mormon, and Brigham Young warned against losing gratitude and humility when blessed.</p>
                            <h5>Tangible Reminders of God’s Goodness</h5>
                            <p>Ancient Israel used physical symbols (frontlets, stones of remembrance, Ebenezer) to remember God’s miracles.</p>
                            <p>These reminders helped them maintain perspective and gratitude.</p>
                            <h5>Modern Ebenezer: The Sacrament</h5>
                            <p>For Latter-day Saints, the bread and water of the sacrament serve as tangible reminders of Christ’s atoning sacrifice.</p>
                            <p>Weekly renewal of covenants helps us keep an eternal perspective.</p>
                            <h5>Role of the Holy Ghost</h5>
                            <p>President Henry B. Eyring taught that the Holy Ghost brings God’s blessings and messages to our remembrance.</p>
                            <p>The Spirit helps us see God’s hand in our lives and stay focused on eternal truths.</p>
                        </div>
                        <h4>Application:</h4>
                        <p>Align spending with eternal values (family, service, education).</p>
                        <p>Ask: Does this purchase bless my family or community?</p>
                        <h4>Reflection prompt</h4>
                        <p>How can I use wealth as a tool for eternal service rather than temporary gain?</p>
