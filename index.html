                <img src="images/family-smaller1.jpg" alt="My wife, child, and I smiling with a forest background">
                <p>I live in Bluffdale, Utah, with my wife and child. I got married in June 2024, and our baby was born 16 months later. 😊 I'm currently studying Software Development through BYU Pathway. I’ve earned around 80 combined credits from several universities, but I’m working toward completing my Bachelor's degree before starting my career. Outside of school, I enjoy spending time with my family—hiking, reading, visiting loved ones, cooking, listening to audiobooks, and playing games.</p>

                <p>Utah is a western state in the United States known for its stunning natural landscapes, rich cultural heritage, and dynamic economy. Covering over 84,900 square miles, it boasts a diverse geography that includes the Rocky Mountains, the Great Salt Lake Desert, and five iconic national parks—Arches, Zion, Bryce Canyon, Capitol Reef, and Canyonlands. The state has deep historical ties to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which continues to shape its cultural identity. In recent years, Utah has also emerged as a hub for innovation, with a rapidly growing tech sector fueling economic expansion.</p>
